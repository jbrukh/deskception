I noticed that periodically I would collect all the files on my desktop into a directory on my desktop. This process would happen iteratively. Now you can have your own "deskception" happen automatically.

To install, create a cron job that periodically runs the deskception script:

    $ crontab -e

and put in a weekly job:

    @weekly /path/to/deskception.sh
